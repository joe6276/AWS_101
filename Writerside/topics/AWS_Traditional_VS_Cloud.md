Its more of making Pizza from Scratch vs Ordering one.

In Traditional Services if you have an idea with new technologies and you are using the traditional way, you have 
to request for:

<ul>
<li> Hardware</li>
<li> Network Cables</li>
<li> Power Cable</li>
<li> Server placement with cooling</li>
<li> Operational and Security Installation </li>
<li>Access granted to requestor in 3-6  weeks </li>
<li> Software installations by requestor</li>
</ul>
