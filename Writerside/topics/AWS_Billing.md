Billing is like renting a Car

## Fundamentals of Pricing

## Duration Pricing 
Just like a car lease, you pay as long as you have the car. An example will be EC2 you will pay as long as the EC2 is running.
This gives more consistency

## Request Pricing
Like a rideshare, you pay each time you 'ride' in the vehicle. This is more like using serverless you will pay only when it runs .
This gives less cost.

## Cost Optimization
- Read the dimension of pricing  before you implement.
- Choose managed services over unmanaged when possible (More request services than duration services)
- Correct expensive sizing
- Use AWS's optimize and save tools when possible

## Maximize the Power of Elasticity
Use auto-scaling and managed services more.
- Scale up when needed
- Don't forget to scale down
- Leverage repeatable scripts  or programs as much as possible so you can delete services and recreate them.
- Use automatic scaling id available and suitble for you use case.

This is for mainly learning and testing
- Free trials - short-term, starting from activation
- Free for 12 Months - For some services, starting from when the account was created.
- Always Free - A certain level of usage is always free for certain services.
