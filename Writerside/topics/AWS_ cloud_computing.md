### Cloud Model
<ul>
<li>Usually includes startup of all sizes.</li>
<li>Runs everything " in the cloud"</li>
<li>Shared Responsibility for security and operations</li>
</ul>

### On Premises Model

<ul>
<li> Minimal to no cloud computing usage</li>
<li> All projects run in a owned data center or a rented data center</li>
<li> Responsible for all security and operations</li>
<li> Can be legacy companies that haven't had a reason to move to the cloud</li>
<li> Can be companies that need strict control and security over the entire infrastructure  e.g. Companies dealing with Government Data .</li>
</ul>

### Hybrid Model 

<ul>
<li>Runs some parts of the application in cloud; other parts are on-premise</li>
<li>Migrates existing applications to the cloud; may leave legacy applications on-premise</li>
<li> Most new applications are designed and built for the cloud</li>
<li> Usually fast connection between on-premise and cloud resources</li>
</ul>
